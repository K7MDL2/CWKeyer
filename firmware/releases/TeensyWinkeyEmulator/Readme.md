Releases/TeensyWinkeyEmulator
=============================


This directory contains two pre-compiled versions of the TeensyWinkeyEmulator,
one running with the "KeyerShield" (featuring a WM8960 audio codec), the other
for a "SGTL5000 prototype" that is a Teensy 4.0 attached to the "official"
Teensy4 AudioShield (that has a SGTL-5000 codec).

The "prototype" is "keyer only", that is, no Microphone/PTT input, and only
a single potentiometer for changing the CW speed. It has inputs for straight
key and paddle, and an output for the headphone.
